A very simple to use java config library.

It's extendable and lightweight, designed for use in relatively small-scale projects that don't need immensely extensive config files.
It's designed to work around the base java properties system, and will work on most java 8+ versions.

I highly reccomend using relocation when bundling this with a project that uses it, in order to make sure no conflicts can occur.


My current projects that will or do use this library:
- [AdvancedBackups](https://github.com/HeatherComputer/AdvancedBackups/)
- [ServerStarted](https://github.com/HeatherComputer/ServerStarted/)
